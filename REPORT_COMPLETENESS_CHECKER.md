5. Re-check before submission

### **API Integration**
```typescript
import { ReportCompletenessService } from './services/reportCompletenessService';

const report = await ReportCompletenessService.analyzeReportCompleteness(
  employeeId,
  month,
  year
);

console.log(`Completeness Score: ${report.overallScore}/100`);
console.log(`Ready for Submission: ${report.isReadyForSubmission}`);
```

## Scoring Algorithm

### **Base Score**: 100 points

### **Deductions**:
- **Critical Issues**: -20 points each
- **High Issues**: -15 points each
- **Medium Issues**: -10 points each
- **Low Issues**: -5 points each

- **Ready**: No critical issues AND ‚â§1 high issue
- **Needs Attention**: Critical issues OR >1 high issue

## Example Output

```typescript
{
  employeeId: "emp123",
  month: 9,
  year: 2025,
  overallScore: 75,
