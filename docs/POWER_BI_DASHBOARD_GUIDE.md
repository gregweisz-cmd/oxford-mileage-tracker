## 🔧 Creating Measures (DAX Formulas)

Here are some key measures you'll want to create:

### 1. Total Miles
```dax
Total Miles = SUM(mileageEntries[miles])
```

### 2. Mileage Amount (at $0.445 per mile)
```dax
Mileage Amount = SUM(mileageEntries[miles]) * 0.445
```

### 3. Total Receipts
```dax
Total Receipts = SUM(receipts[amount])
```

### 4. Total Expenses
```dax
Total Expenses = [Mileage Amount] + [Total Receipts]
```

### 5. Total Hours
```dax
Total Hours = SUM(timeTracking[hours])
```

### 6. Average Miles per Day
```dax
Average Miles per Day = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Miles],
    DISTINCTCOUNT(mileageEntries[date]),
    0
)
```

### 7. Days with Activity
```dax
Days with Activity = 
DISTINCTCOUNT(
    UNION(
        VALUES(mileageEntries[date]),
        VALUES(receipts[date]),
        VALUES(timeTracking[date])
    )
)
```

### 8. Expenses This Month
```dax
Expenses This Month = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Expenses],
    FILTER(
        ALL(mileageEntries[date], receipts[date]),
        MONTH(mileageEntries[date]) = MONTH(TODAY()) &&
        YEAR(mileageEntries[date]) = YEAR(TODAY())
    )
)
```

## 📅 Date Filtering Best Practices

### Create a Date Table
For better date filtering, create a separate Date table:

1. **New Table** → Enter Data
2. Create a date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31)
3. Add columns: Year, Month, MonthName, Week, DayOfWeek, etc.
4. Create relationship: Date table `Date` column → mileageEntries `date` column

### Use Date Slicers
- Add a **Date Slicer** to your dashboards
- Connect it to your Date table
- This will filter all related tables automatically

---

## 🎯 Quick Start: Your First Dashboard

1. **Create a new page** in Power BI Desktop

2. **Add these visuals**:
   - **Card**: Total Expenses (use the measure above)
   - **Card**: Total Miles
   - **Card**: Total Hours
   - **Line Chart**: Expenses by Month (X: date, Y: Total Expenses)
   - **Pie Chart**: Expenses by Cost Center

3. **Add a Date Slicer**:
   - Connect to your date field
   - Set to "Between" mode for date range selection

4. **Format your visuals**:
   - Choose a color scheme
   - Add titles
   - Adjust font sizes

5. **Test interactivity**:
   - Click on chart elements to see cross-filtering
   - Use the date slicer to filter data

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Tooltips**: Create tooltip pages with detailed breakdowns that appear on hover

2. **Bookmarks**: Save specific filter states as bookmarks for quick navigation

3. **Drill-through**: Set up drill-through pages for detailed views (e.g., click an employee to see their detailed activity)

4. **Conditional Formatting**: Use color coding to highlight high/low values

5. **KPIs**: Use KPI visuals for targets vs actuals (if you have budget data)

6. **Refresh Schedule**: Set up automatic refresh in Power BI Service (daily/weekly)

---

## 🔄 Refreshing Data

### Manual Refresh
- In Power BI Desktop: **Home** → **Refresh**

### Automatic Refresh (Power BI Service)
1. Publish your report to Power BI Service
2. Go to **Dataset Settings**
3. Configure **Scheduled Refresh**
4. Set frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)

**Note**: Your backend endpoint supports query parameters for filtering:
- `?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31` - Filter by date range
- `?employeeId=greg-weisz-001` - Filter by employee
