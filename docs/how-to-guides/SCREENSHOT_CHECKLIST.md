# Screenshot Checklist for PDF Guides

**All existing screenshots have been cleared.** Use **`SCREENSHOTS_NEEDED.md`** in this folder as the single run list for capturing screenshots.

## Quick reference

- **Mobile app screenshots:** Save to `images/screenshots/mobile-app/` (11 screenshots).
- **Web portal screenshots (Staff, Supervisor, Admin):** Save to `images/screenshots/web-portal/` (39 screenshots total for the three guides).

**Total to capture for current PDFs:** 50 screenshots (11 mobile + 39 web-portal).

Finance and Contracts portal screenshots are deferred until those portals are tuned; see `SCREENSHOTS_NEEDED.md` for the full list and capture instructions.

## After capturing

1. Save each file with the **exact filename** listed in `SCREENSHOTS_NEEDED.md`.
2. Regenerate PDFs from the templates (e.g. run the script in `scripts/` if available).
3. Spot-check PDFs to ensure screenshots display correctly.
