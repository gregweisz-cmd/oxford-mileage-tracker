# Quick Fix for GPS Tracked Drives Not Showing

## The Real Problem Found

Your mobile app is creating a **fresh database** each time, not using the one with GPS entries. The logs show:

```
🔧 Database: Found employees: 0
🔧 Database: No employees found, creating test employees...
```

This means the app deleted the old database and created a new one with **NO GPS ENTRIES**.

## ✅ Solution: Sync GPS Entries from Backend

I've added code to automatically sync from the backend, but we need to complete one more step:

### Step 1: Login Screen

You need to **login first**. The app shows:
```
🔧 Database: No current employee session found
```

**Action:** On the mobile app, you should see a **Login Screen**. Login as **Greg Weisz**.

### Step 2: After Login

Once logged in, the HomeScreen will:
1. ✅ Auto-sync from backend (code already added)
2. ✅ Pull down all 8 GPS tracked entries 
3. ✅ Display them in Recent Activities

## 🔍 What I See in Your Logs

Good news:
- ✅ App initialized successfully
- ✅ Database created
- ✅ 41 employees created (including Greg Weisz)
- ✅ Backend API accessible at 192.168.86.101:3002
- ✅ Sync code is in place

Needs attention:
- ❌ No current employee logged in → You need to login
- ❌ No GPS entries synced yet → Will sync after login

## 🚀 What to Do Right Now

1. **Look at your mobile app screen** - Do you see a Login screen?
2. **If YES**: Login as Greg Weisz
3. **If NO**: Navigate to Settings/Login and login
4. **After login**: The app will auto-sync and you'll see GPS entries!

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

Take a screenshot of:
1. The mobile app screen (what you're seeing)
