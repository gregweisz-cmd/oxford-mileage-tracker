# GPS Tracked Drives Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
GPS tracked drives were not showing up in the Recent Activities section or Reports section of the web portal.

## Root Cause
The GPS tracked mileage entries in the database had **invalid employee IDs** that didn't match any employees in the employees table:
- `emp1` (invalid) 
- `emp2` (invalid)
- `mgb89ph1f4ilwxwkan` (invalid/old ID)

This caused:
1. Database JOINs to fail when fetching mileage entries with employee names
2. Entries to appear as "Unknown" employee
3. Filtering by employee to exclude these entries

## Fix Applied
Updated all GPS tracked mileage entries to use valid employee IDs:

| Old Employee ID | New Employee ID | Employee Name | Entries Updated |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| `emp1` | `greg-weisz-001` | Greg Weisz | 2 |
| `emp2` | `mgi4f64mhb9xyk2ahes` | Jackson Longan | 1 |
| `mgb89ph1f4ilwxwkan` | `greg-weisz-001` | Greg Weisz | 6 |

**Total: 9 GPS tracked entries fixed**

## Current GPS Entries by Employee

### Greg Weisz (8 entries)
- October 2025: 3 entries (15.2 mi, 45.8 mi, 47.7 mi)
- June 2024: 5 entries (346 mi, 298 mi, 212 mi, 48 mi, 30 mi)

### Jackson Longan (1 entry)
- October 2025: 1 entry (25.5 mi)

## Verification
âœ… API endpoints now return GPS entries with correct employee associations:
```
GET /api/mileage-entries?employeeId=greg-weisz-001&month=10&year=2025
```

Returns 3 GPS tracked drives for October 2025.

## What to Do Next

### For Users:
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to clear the cache
2. Log in as Greg Weisz or Jackson Longan
3. Navigate to the Staff Portal for October 2025
4. GPS tracked drives should now appear in:
   - Recent Activities section
   - Reports section
   - Mileage tab

### For Developers:
The root cause appears to be a sync issue between the mobile app and web portal. The mobile app is creating mileage entries with employee IDs that don't exist in the web database.

**Recommended Action:**
- Investigate the employee authentication/sync mechanism between mobile and web
- Ensure employee IDs are consistent across both platforms
- Consider adding a foreign key constraint to prevent orphaned mileage entries in the future
