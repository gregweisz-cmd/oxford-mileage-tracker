# Database Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Removed All Demo/Mock Data from Web Portal
- **Deleted** `mockEmployeeData` (Greg Weisz June 2024 data)
- **Deleted** `mockReceipts` array
- **Removed** special case logic that loaded mock data for Greg Weisz June 2024
- **Result**: Web portal now ONLY loads real data from the backend API

### 2. ✅ Removed All "(off)" Hardcoded Text
- **Frontend (`StaffPortal.tsx`)**: Removed all hardcoded `'(off)'` text
- **Frontend (`useEmployeeData.ts`)**: Changed descriptions to empty strings instead of `'(off)'`
- **Backend (`server.js`)**: No "(off)" text found (was already clean)
- **Mobile App (`src/`)**: No "(off)" text found (was already clean)

### 3. ✅ Backend Database Cleanup
- **Created** `cleanup-all-demo-data.js` script (kept for future use)
- **Verified** backend database is clean (tables don't exist yet = fresh start)
- **Cleaned up** temporary debug scripts

### 4. ✅ Manual Cleanup Process
- **Manual deletion** in the mobile app's Daily Description screen works correctly
- **Automated cleanup** was attempted but didn't work properly (removed)
- **Best approach**: Manually delete "(off)" text from Daily Descriptions in the mobile app

## The Root Cause of "(off)" Text Reappearing

The "(off)" text is stored in **your mobile app's local database** on your device. When you:
1. Delete "(off)" in the web portal
2. Click Save
3. Data refreshes from the backend
4. Backend loads data from the mobile app's database
5. Mobile app still has "(off)" in its database
6. So "(off)" comes back!

## How to Fix It Permanently

### Method 1: Manual Deletion (Recommended - Works!)
1. **Open the mobile app**
2. **Go to Daily Description screen**
3. **Find days with "(off)" text**
4. **Delete the "(off)" text** for each day
5. **Save each entry**
6. **Repeat** for all days with "(off)"
7. **Go to web portal** and refresh - "(off)" should be gone!

### Method 2: Clear App Data (Nuclear Option - Fastest)

If you want to completely start fresh with no demo data:

#### Clear App Data:
1. On your device, go to **Settings → Apps → Oxford Mileage Tracker**
2. Click **Storage → Clear Data**
3. Reopen the app (it will start fresh)

#### Reinstall the App:
1. Uninstall the Oxford Mileage Tracker app
2. Reinstall it from the app store or development build
3. Log in and start with clean data

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- ✅ `admin-web/backend/cleanup-all-demo-data.js` - Backend cleanup script (KEEP THIS)
- ✅ `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- ✅ `admin-web/src/StaffPortal.tsx` - Removed mock data and special case logic
- ✅ `admin-web/src/hooks/useEmployeeData.ts` - Removed "(off)" text from descriptions

### Deleted:
- ✅ `check-database.js` - Temporary debug script
- ✅ `admin-web/backend/check-database.js` - Temporary debug script
- ✅ `admin-web/backend/cleanup-off-text.js` - Temporary cleanup script
- ✅ `src/services/databaseCleanup.ts` - Non-functional cleanup utility (manual deletion works better)

## Next Steps

1. **Manually delete remaining "(off)" text** in the mobile app's Daily Description screen
2. **Test the web portal** - delete "(off)", save, refresh - it should stay deleted
3. **If you want a fresh start**, clear app data or reinstall (see Method 2 above)
4. **Import your real employee data** using the bulk import feature
5. **Start using the app with real data**

## Notes

- The backend database (`expense_tracker.db`) is currently empty/fresh - this is good!
- The mobile app stores data locally on each device using SQLite
- The web portal loads data from the backend API, which syncs from mobile app databases
- All code changes have been made to prevent "(off)" text from being added in the future
- **Manual deletion in the Daily Description screen works correctly** - this is the recommended approach

## Confirmed Working Solution

✅ **Manual deletion of "(off)" text in the mobile app's Daily Description screen works and persists correctly!**

After manually deleting "(off)" from the mobile app:
1. The changes save successfully
2. The web portal can then save/refresh without "(off)" coming back
3. No automated cleanup tool needed - manual deletion is reliable
