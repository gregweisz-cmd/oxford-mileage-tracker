### Manual Mileage Entry Screen

## Test Drive Checklist

### GPS Tracking Test
- [ ] Open mobile app
- [ ] Tap "Start GPS Tracking"
- [ ] Verify cost center selector shows only YOUR selected cost centers
- [ ] Verify your default cost center is pre-selected
- [ ] Enter starting odometer
- [ ] Enter purpose
- [ ] Start tracking
- [ ] Drive around
- [ ] Stop tracking
- [ ] Select end location
- [ ] Verify miles calculated
- [ ] Save entry

### Manual Entry Test
- [ ] Tap "Manual Entry"
- [ ] Verify cost center selector shows only YOUR selected cost centers
- [ ] Verify your default cost center is pre-selected
- [ ] Enter all fields
- [ ] Save entry

### Verify Data Synced
- [ ] Open web portal
- [ ] Go to Staff Portal
- [ ] Check if your mileage entries appear
- [ ] Verify cost centers are correct

---

## Expected Behavior

### Cost Center Selector
**If you have 1 cost center:**
- Selector won't show (automatically uses that one)

**If you have 2+ cost centers:**
- Selector shows as button chips
- Your default cost center is pre-selected (highlighted blue)
- Tap any chip to change selection
- Only shows YOUR assigned cost centers (not all 50+)

### Example
If Goose Weisz has:
- Selected Cost Centers: `["AL-SOR", "G&A", "Fundraising"]`
- Default Cost Center: `"AL-SOR"`

Then the selector will show:
```
[AL-SOR (selected)] [G&A] [Fundraising]
```

## What to Look For During Test

### GPS Tracking
1. Does the odometer pre-fill correctly?
2. Does GPS track accurately?
3. Does the distance calculate correctly?
4. Does the cost center default to yours?
5. Can you select different cost centers?
6. Does the entry save successfully?

### Manual Entry
1. Can you enter all fields easily?
2. Does the cost center default to yours?
3. Can you change cost centers?
4. Does save work correctly?

### Data Sync
1. Do entries appear in web portal?
2. Is the cost center correct?
3. Is the data accurate?

---

## Troubleshooting

### If cost centers don't appear:
1. Check that Goose Weisz has cost centers assigned in web portal
2. Logout and login again on mobile
3. Check that `selectedCostCenters` is not empty

### If wrong cost center is selected:
1. Check the `defaultCostCenter` in web portal
2. Make sure it's one of the `selectedCostCenters`
3. Update in web portal and re-login on mobile

### If entries don't sync:
1. Check backend is running (`http://192.168.86.101:3002/api/health`)
2. Check network connection
3. Look for sync errors in console
