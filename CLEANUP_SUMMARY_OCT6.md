# System Cleanup Summary - October 6, 2025

## 🧹 Cleanup Completed

All demo data and test data have been removed from the system. The application now uses a **unified employee list** sourced from the bulk import (Google Sheets) across all systems.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Mobile App Cleanup** (`App.tsx`)
- ✅ **Removed TestDataService.initializeTestData()** - No longer creating test employees
- ✅ **Removed DemoDataService.createGregJune2024Data()** - No longer creating demo expense data
- ✅ **Commented out imports** - TestDataService and DemoDataService are no longer used
- ✅ **Backend authentication** - Mobile app now authenticates against backend API

### 2. **Login System Update** (`LoginScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ **Backend API authentication** - Logs in using `/api/employee-login` endpoint
- ✅ **Syncs backend employee data** - Creates local employee record with backend's employee ID
- ✅ **Unified employee IDs** - Mobile app and web portal now use the same employee IDs
- ✅ **Fallback to local** - Still works offline with local authentication

### 3. **Data Sync Implementation** (`MileageEntryScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ **Automatic backend sync** - All mileage entries sync to backend when created
- ✅ **Correct network addressing** - Uses `192.168.86.101:3002` for local development
- ✅ **Graceful offline handling** - Continues to work if backend is unreachable
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - WebSocket broadcasts changes to all connected clients

### 4. **Bug Fixes**
- ✅ **Fixed duplicate detection error** - Safe date handling with proper null checks
- ✅ **Fixed name consistency** - Changed "Goose Weisz" to "Greg Weisz" everywhere
- ✅ **Fixed UI layout** - Miles input now above Calculate/Optimize/Test buttons

## 📊 Current System State

### **Employee Data Source**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Backend database (`admin-web/backend/oxford_tracker.db`)
- **Employee Count**: 252 employees from bulk import
- **Data Source**: Google Sheets bulk import (Employee_ID, Name, Email, Cost Centers)

### **Mobile App**
- **Authentication**: Backend API (`/api/employee-login`)
- **Employee Storage**: Local SQLite with backend employee IDs
- **Data Sync**: Automatic sync to backend for mileage, receipts, time tracking
- **Offline Support**: Works offline, syncs when connection restored

### **Web Portal**
- **Authentication**: Backend API
- **Data Loading**: DataSyncService with caching and real-time updates
- **Employee Management**: Admin portal for bulk import and individual management
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket connection for live updates

## 🔄 Data Flow (After Cleanup)

```
Backend Database (Single Source of Truth)

    ↓         ↓

  Real-time Sync (WebSocket)
```

### **Employee Login Flow:**
1. User enters email/password in mobile app
2. Mobile app authenticates with backend API
3. Backend returns employee data with correct ID
4. Mobile app creates/updates local employee record with backend ID
5. All subsequent data (mileage, receipts, time tracking) uses backend employee ID
6. Data syncs to backend and appears on web portal

---

## 🗑️ What Was Removed

### **Test Data Files (Still Exist But No Longer Used)**
- `src/services/testDataService.ts` - Contains hardcoded test employees
- `src/services/demoDataService.ts` - Contains Greg Weisz June 2024 demo data

**Note**: These files still exist but are commented out in `App.tsx`, so they won't run.

### **Demo Mileage Entries**
- Greg Weisz June 2024 entries (removed from initialization)
- Test employee entries (no longer created)

### **Demo Receipts**
- Comcast and Verizon receipts (cleaned up by `cleanupOldReceipts()`)
- Any receipts older than 60 days

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Tomorrow

### **Employee ID Consistency**
The mobile app previously used employee ID `mgb89ph1f4ilwxwkan` for Greg Weisz, but the backend uses `mgfftbw93yetq3d77y9`. After logging out and back in tomorrow:

1. **Log out** of the mobile app
2. **Log back in** with `greg.weisz@oxfordhouse.org` / `Gregwelcome1`
3. Mobile app will authenticate with backend and get ID `mgfftbw93yetq3d77y9`
4. All new entries will use the correct ID
5. Web portal will show all new entries

### **Old Data**
Manual entries created today (10/3 and 10/4) were saved with the old employee ID (`mgb89ph1f4ilwxwkan`) and won't appear on the web portal. You can either:
- **Re-enter them** after logging back in (they'll sync correctly)
- **Ignore them** (they're just test data anyway)

---

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Starting Point

When you return tomorrow, the system will be in a clean state:

### **What Works:**
- ✅ **252 employees** from bulk import available for login
- ✅ **Backend authentication** on both mobile and web
- ✅ **Real-time sync** between mobile app and web portal
- ✅ **Data entry forms** in web portal
- ✅ **Enhanced UI/UX** with toast notifications and status indicators
- ✅ **Unified employee IDs** across all systems

### **To Start Testing:**
1. Open mobile app at `http://localhost:8082`
2. Log out and log back in as `greg.weisz@oxfordhouse.org`
3. Create test entries (mileage, receipts, time tracking)
4. Verify they appear on web portal `http://localhost:3000`
5. Test real-time sync by making changes in both interfaces

---

## 📦 Services Running

Make sure these are running tomorrow:

1. **Backend Server**: `cd admin-web/backend && npm start` (port 3002)
2. **Web Portal**: `cd admin-web && npm start` (port 3000)
3. **Mobile App**: `npx expo start --port 8082` (port 8082)
