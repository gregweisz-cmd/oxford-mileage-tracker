# Feature Roadmap - Oxford House Mileage Tracker

## Overview
This document outlines the upcoming features and improvements based on recent presentation feedback. These enhancements will improve usability, add new functionality, and enhance safety features for our expense tracking system.

## 1. Summary Sheet Editing
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High

Staff members will be able to edit expense amounts directly in the Summary Sheet. This allows for manual adjustments when needed, with validation to ensure accuracy.

**Benefits:**
- Quick corrections without navigating to individual entries
- Better control over expense reporting
- Maintains data integrity with validation

---

## 2. Mandatory Descriptions for Other Expenses
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High

When staff members add expenses in the "Other Expenses" category, a description will now be required. This ensures Finance has clear information about what the expense was for.

**Benefits:**
- Better expense documentation
- Easier review and approval process
- Clearer audit trail

---

## 3. Receipt Image Viewing & Editing
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High

Fixing the issue where receipt images appear as broken file icons in the mobile app. Adding the ability to view and edit receipt images properly.

**Benefits:**
- Reliable receipt image access
- Ability to review and verify receipts
- Better mobile app experience

---

## 4. Contracts Portal
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium

Creating a new portal specifically for the Contracts team for reviewing expense reports. Unlike the Finance portal, Contracts will have read-only access for review purposes (no approval functionality). This supports their quarterly audit process.

**Benefits:**
- Dedicated workspace for Contracts team
- Review capabilities without approval workflow
- Supports quarterly audit requirements
- Better organization of workflow

**Future Enhancement:** Quarterly audit functionality will be added in a future phase to support the Contracts team's audit process.

## 5. Per Diem Rules Management
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium

Finance and Contracts teams will be able to add and edit Cost Center per diem rules directly from their portals, without needing Admin access.

**Benefits:**
- More flexible rule management
- Faster updates to per diem policies
- Better delegation of responsibilities

---

## 6. Persistent 50+ Hours Alerts
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High

When employees work 50+ hours, supervisors will receive persistent alerts (both in notifications and dashboard) that remain visible until addressed. This helps ensure employees aren't overworking.

**Benefits:**
- Better work-life balance monitoring
- Proactive supervisor intervention
- Prevents employee burnout
- Alerts don't get missed

---

## 7. Persistent Mileage Tracking Notification
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium

When GPS tracking detects no movement for 5 minutes, a persistent notification will appear and remain visible until the user stops tracking or dismisses it. This prevents forgotten active tracking sessions.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental mileage tracking
- Saves battery life
- Reduces incorrect mileage entries
- Clear reminder to stop tracking

---

## 8. Clock In/Clock Out Functionality
**Status:** Under Consideration  
**Priority:** Low

Adding a simple clock in/clock out feature for staff to use on both mobile app and web portal. This would automatically track work hours.

**Benefits:**
- Simplified time tracking
- Automatic hour calculation
- Available on all platforms

**Note:** This feature is being evaluated and may be implemented in a future phase.

---

## 9. Preferred Name Clarification
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Low

Adding clear notes throughout the app explaining that preferred names are only used for addressing users in the app and web portal, and will not appear on expense reports.

**Benefits:**
- Clearer user expectations
- Reduces confusion
- Better user experience

---

## 10. Personalized Portal Naming
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Low

Changing "Staff Portal" to show the user's preferred name (e.g., "Greg's Portal"). This personalizes the experience while maintaining clarity.

**Benefits:**
- More personalized experience
- Easier to identify your workspace
- Better user engagement

---

## Implementation Timeline

Features will be implemented in priority order, with high-priority items addressed first. The development team will work through these systematically, ensuring each feature is fully tested before moving to the next.

**Estimated Start:** Pending approval
