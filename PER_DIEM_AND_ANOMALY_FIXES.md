# Per Diem and Anomaly Detection Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Per Diem Receipts Not Showing in Per Diem Tile ✅

**Problem:**
- Receipts with category "Per Diem" were being added to the Receipts total but not showing in the Per Diem tile
- The Per Diem tile was calculating based on mileage eligibility rather than actual Per Diem receipts

**Solution:**
- Modified `UnifiedDataService.getDayData()` and `getMonthData()` to exclude "Per Diem" category receipts from the regular receipts total
- Updated `UnifiedDataService.getDashboardSummary()` to return a new `totalPerDiemReceipts` field
- Modified `DashboardService.getDashboardStats()` to include the new `totalPerDiemReceipts` field
- Updated `HomeScreen.tsx` to use Per Diem receipts instead of calculated Per Diem from mileage

**Files Changed:**
- `src/services/unifiedDataService.ts`
  - Line 104-106: Filter out Per Diem receipts from regular receipts total in `getDayData()`
  - Line 234-237: Filter out Per Diem receipts from regular receipts total in `getMonthData()`
  - Line 342-374: Added `totalPerDiemReceipts` to dashboard summary
- `src/services/dashboardService.ts`
  - Line 14-25: Added `totalPerDiemReceipts` to return type
  - Line 59: Pass through `totalPerDiemReceipts` from summary
  - Line 74: Include in error return object
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`
  - Line 323-332: Use Per Diem receipts total instead of calculated Per Diem

### 2. Missing $350 Monthly Per Diem Limit Warning ✅

**Problem:**
- No warning when employees approach or exceed the $350 monthly Per Diem limit

**Solution:**
- Added visual warnings to the Per Diem tile:
  - Orange warning when Per Diem reaches $300+ (shows "$XX left")
  - Red warning when Per Diem reaches $350 (shows "LIMIT REACHED ⚠️")
- Added console warnings for debugging
- Icon color changes based on limit proximity

**Files Changed:**
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`
  - Line 327-332: Console warnings when approaching/reaching limit
  - Line 1057-1084: Updated Per Diem tile with visual warnings and color coding

**Visual Indicators:**
- Purple icon & text: Normal (< $300)
- Orange icon & text: Warning ($300-$349.99)
- Red icon & text: Limit reached (>= $350)

### 3. False "Similar Trips" Warning on First Trip ✅

**Problem:**
- Warning about "similar trips" appearing even when logging the first trip of the day
- The anomaly detection was comparing the newly created entry against itself

**Solution:**
- Modified `checkDuplicateTripAnomaly()` to exclude the new entry from the comparison
- Added filter to prevent comparing an entry against itself: `entry.id !== newEntry.id`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/services/anomalyDetectionService.ts`
  - Line 470: Added comment clarifying exclusion
  - Line 477: Filter out the new entry from recent entries comparison

## Receipt Categories

The system now properly recognizes and segregates these receipt categories:

**Regular Receipts** (counted in Receipts tile):
- EES
- Rental Car
- Rental Car Fuel
- Office Supplies
- Ground Transportation
- Phone/Internet/Fax
- Postage/Shipping
- Printing
- Airfare/Bus/Train
- Parking/Tolls
- Hotels/AirBnB
- Other

**Per Diem Receipts** (counted in Per Diem tile):
- Per Diem

## Testing

To test these fixes:

1. **Per Diem Receipts:**
   - Add a receipt with category "Per Diem"
   - Verify it appears in the Per Diem tile, NOT the Receipts tile
   - Check that the amount is correct

2. **$350 Limit Warning:**
   - Add Per Diem receipts totaling $300+
   - Verify the tile turns orange and shows remaining amount
   - Add more to exceed $350
   - Verify the tile turns red and shows "LIMIT REACHED ⚠️"

3. **Similar Trips Warning:**
   - Create the first mileage entry of the day
   - Verify NO warning appears about similar trips
   - Create a second similar entry
   - Verify warning DOES appear for the duplicate

## Implementation Notes

- Per Diem is now tracked via receipts with category "Per Diem" rather than calculated from mileage eligibility
- The $350 monthly limit is a hard cap per IRS regulations
- The anomaly detection now properly excludes newly created entries from duplicate comparison
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing data
