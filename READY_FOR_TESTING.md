- ‚úÖ **Auto-Sync** - Data syncs to backend within 5-10 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Delete Entries** - Deletes from both phone and backend
- ‚úÖ **Date Preservation** - Dates stay correct across timezones
- ‚úÖ **Receipt Capture** - Take photos and categorize receipts
- ‚úÖ **Per Diem** - Auto-calculates based on rules
- ‚úÖ **Time Tracking** - Log hours worked
- ‚úÖ **No Duplicate GPS Badges** - Clean UI

### Backend
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints** - All CRUD operations working
- ‚úÖ **Database Storage** - SQLite storing all data correctly
- ‚úÖ **WebSocket** - Real-time sync active
- ‚úÖ **Logging** - All requests logged for debugging

### Web Portal
- ‚úÖ **Staff Portal** - Displays all employee data
- ‚úÖ **Cost Center Travel Sheet** - Editable cells

## Critical Bugs Fixed Today

### 1. Catastrophic Sync Bug ‚≠ê
**Problem**: Mobile app not syncing to backend at all  
**Root Cause**: Entity type case mismatch (`mileageentry` vs `mileageEntry`)  
**Data sent as**: `"mileageentrys"` ‚ùå  
**Backend expected**: `"mileageEntries"` ‚úÖ  
**Result**: Backend silently ignored all mobile data  
**Fix**: Explicit entity type mapping preserving camelCase  
**Impact**: Complete sync failure ‚Üí Now working perfectly  

### 2. Duplicate GPS Tracked Badge
**Problem**: Badge showing twice in Quick Actions  
**Fix**: Removed duplicate badge  

### 3. Web Portal Cells Not Editable
**Problem**: Couldn't click cells in Cost Center Travel Sheet  
**Fix**: Removed `isAdminView` restrictions  

### 4. Date Timezone Issues
**Problem**: Dates off by one day due to timezone conversion  
**Fix**: Send dates as YYYY-MM-DD at noon UTC  

### 5. Delete Causing App Reload
**Problem**: Deleted entries kept reappearing  
**Fix**: Delete from both local DB and backend  

### 6. Update Entry Error
**Problem**: "no such column: startLocationDetails"  
**Fix**: Map location details objects to separate columns

## Testing Setup

### For Local Testing (at home):
1. **Backend**: Running on `localhost:3002`
2. **Frontend**: Running on `localhost:3000`
3. **Mobile App**: Scan QR from `npx expo start`
4. **Config**: `USE_PRODUCTION_FOR_TESTING = false` (uses localhost)

### For Remote Testing (while driving):
1. **Change config**: Set `USE_PRODUCTION_FOR_TESTING = true`
2. **Restart app**: Reload to apply change
3. **Sync destination**: Render.com (accessible anywhere)
4. **View data**: https://oxford-mileage-tracker.vercel.app

**Current Status**: Configured for **LOCAL testing** (syncs to localhost)
