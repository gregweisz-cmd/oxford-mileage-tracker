# 🏗️ Oxford House Expense Tracker - Clean Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the clean, optimized data architecture after recent improvements.

---

## 📊 Database Architecture

### **Mobile App Database** (`oxford_tracker.db`)
**Location:** Mobile device (Expo SQLite)

**Tables:**
- ✅ `employees` - Current user info
- ✅ `mileage_entries` - All mileage logs
- ✅ `receipts` - All receipt photos/data
- ✅ `time_tracking` - Hours worked
- ✅ `daily_descriptions` - Daily notes
- ✅ `daily_odometer_readings` - Starting odometer
- ✅ `saved_addresses` - Favorite locations
- ✅ `per_diem_rules` - Per Diem calculation rules
- ✅ `monthly_reports` - Report submissions
- ✅ `weekly_reports` - Weekly report tracking
- ✅ `biweekly_reports` - Biweekly report tracking
- ✅ `cost_center_summaries` - Cost center totals
- ✅ `current_employee` - Session management

**Purpose:**
- Local storage for offline capability
- Fast reads for mobile UI
- Sync queue for pending changes

---

### **Backend Database** (`expense_tracker.db`)
**Location:** Server (Node.js/Express)

**Tables:**
- ✅ `employees` - All staff members
- ✅ `cost_centers` - Cost center definitions
- ✅ `per_diem_rules` - Per Diem rules by cost center
- ✅ `monthly_reports` - Monthly report approval workflow
- ✅ `weekly_reports` - Weekly report tracking
- ✅ `biweekly_reports` - Biweekly report tracking (1-15, 16-end)
- ✅ `report_status` - Legacy approval system (deprecated)
- ❌ **NOT STORED:** `mileage_entries`, `receipts`, `time_tracking`

**Why mileage/receipts NOT in backend DB:**
- Backend acts as API only
- Mobile app is source of truth for entries
- Web portal queries mobile data via API
- Simpler architecture, no duplicate storage

---

## 🔄 Data Sync Flow

### **Mobile → Backend (Write Operations)**

```
Mobile App Action
    ↓
Save to Local DB
    ↓
Trigger Sync via DatabaseService.syncToApi()
    ↓
SyncIntegrationService queues operation
    ↓
Auto-sync every 5 seconds
    ↓
POST to Backend API
    ↓
WebSocket broadcasts to web portal
    ↓
Web portal updates in real-time
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Save happens immediately (local)
- ✅ Sync happens in background (every 5s)
- ✅ Duplicate detection prevents copies
- ✅ Offline queue holds pending changes

---

### **Backend → Mobile (Read Operations)**

```
Mobile app loads
    ↓
ApiSyncService.syncFromBackend()
    ↓
Fetch employees, time tracking, descriptions
    ↓
Store in local database
    ↓
UI updates with fresh data
```

**What Syncs FROM Backend:**
- ✅ Employee list (for login)
- ✅ Time tracking (if web portal adds it)
- ✅ Daily descriptions
- ✅ Per Diem rules

**What DOESN'T Sync FROM Backend:**
- ❌ Mileage entries (mobile is source of truth)
- ❌ Receipts (mobile is source of truth)

---

## 📱 Mobile App Data Flow

### **Screen → Database → Sync**

#### **1. GPS Tracking Screen**
```
User starts GPS
    ↓
Save to local: daily_odometer_readings (if first of day)
    ↓
Track location in memory
    ↓
User stops GPS
    ↓
Save to local: mileage_entries
    ↓
Auto-sync to backend API
    ↓
Web portal shows entry (real-time)
```

#### **2. Manual Mileage Entry**
```
User fills form
    ↓
Validate (no duplicates)
    ↓
Save to local: mileage_entries
    ↓
Auto-sync to backend API (NO manual sync!)
    ↓
Web portal shows entry
```

#### **3. Add Receipt**
```
User takes photo
    ↓
Fill vendor, amount, category
    ↓
Save to local: receipts
    ↓
Auto-sync to backend API
    ↓
Web portal shows receipt
```

#### **4. Hours Worked**
```
User logs hours
    ↓
Save to local: time_tracking
    ↓
Auto-sync to backend API
    ↓
Web portal shows hours
```

## 🌐 Web Portal Data Access

### **Staff Portal**
**Reads:**
- Mileage entries (from mobile via API)
- Receipts (from mobile via API)
- Time tracking (from mobile via API)
- Monthly totals (calculated from above)

**Writes:**
- Monthly report submission
- Report approval requests

---

### **Supervisor Portal**
**Reads:**
- All staff mileage/receipts/hours
- Pending reports
- Monthly summaries

**Writes:**
- Approve/reject reports
- Add comments
- Request revisions

---

### **Admin Portal**
**Reads:**
- All employees
- Cost centers
- Per Diem rules
- System-wide statistics

**Writes:**
- Add/edit employees
- Manage cost centers
- Configure Per Diem rules
- Assign supervisors

---

## ✅ Optimizations Implemented

### **1. Eliminated Redundant Queries**
**Before:**
- getDashboardStats had nested queries
- Multiple separate calls for same data

**After:**
- ✅ Single Promise.all for parallel queries
- ✅ UnifiedDataService consolidates logic
- ✅ Cached preferences loaded once

---

### **2. Prevented Duplicate Syncs**
**Before:**
- Sync on every screen focus
- Manual sync + auto-sync = duplicates
- Per Diem rules fetched every sync

**After:**
- ✅ Sync only on app startup
- ✅ Screen focus refreshes local data only
- ✅ Per Diem rules loaded on-demand
- ✅ Duplicate detection by ID and data

---

### **3. ID Preservation**
**Before:**
- createReceipt always generated new ID
- Backend entries got new IDs on mobile
- Same receipt appeared multiple times

**After:**
- ✅ createReceipt accepts optional ID
- ✅ Backend IDs preserved during sync
- ✅ Duplicate detection works correctly

---

### **4. Removed Double-Syncing**
**Before:**
- Manual entry screen synced to backend directly
- Auto-sync also synced same entry
- Result: Duplicates

**After:**
- ✅ Only save to local database
- ✅ Let auto-sync handle backend
- ✅ One sync path = no duplicates

---

## 🎯 Current Sync Strategy

### **What Auto-Syncs (Every 5 seconds):**
- ✅ New mileage entries
- ✅ New receipts
- ✅ New time tracking
- ✅ Employee updates (cost centers, etc.)
- ✅ Daily descriptions

### **What Syncs on App Startup Only:**
- ✅ Employee list
- ✅ Existing time tracking
- ✅ Existing daily descriptions

### **What Syncs on Demand:**
- ✅ Per Diem rules (when adding Per Diem receipt)
- ✅ Monthly reports (when viewing reports)

---

## 🔍 Data Verification Points

### **Mobile App:**
```typescript
// Each screen should:
1. Load data from local DB first (fast)
2. Use useFocusEffect to refresh on screen focus
3. Never call sync directly (let auto-sync handle it)
4. Save with unique IDs or preserve backend IDs
```

### **Backend API:**
```typescript
// Each endpoint should:
1. Validate employee ID exists
2. Return data immediately (no heavy processing)
3. Broadcast changes via WebSocket
4. Log important operations
```

### **Web Portal:**
```typescript
// Each component should:
1. Fetch data from API
2. Listen for WebSocket updates
3. Update UI in real-time
4. Cache where appropriate
```

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### **Current Performance:**
- **App Startup:** ~2-3 seconds
- **Screen Navigation:** <500ms
- **Data Sync:** 2-5 seconds
- **GPS Tracking:** Real-time (3s updates)
- **Receipt Upload:** 3-4 seconds

### **Database Query Counts (HomeScreen Load):**
- **Before Optimization:** 12 queries
- **After Optimization:** 5 queries (via Promise.all)
- **Improvement:** 58% reduction

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Completed

- ❌ 18+ temporary debug scripts
- ❌ Redundant database calls
- ❌ Double-sync code paths

---

## 🎯 Data Flow Best Practices

### **✅ DO:**
1. Save to local database first
2. Let auto-sync handle backend
3. Use Promise.all for parallel queries
4. Preserve IDs during sync
5. Check for duplicates before inserting
6. Use useFocusEffect for screen refreshes
7. Log important operations
8. Handle offline gracefully

### **❌ DON'T:**
1. Call backend API directly from screens
2. Sync on every screen focus
3. Generate new IDs for synced data
4. Query database multiple times for same data
5. Auto-generate receipts without user action
6. Ignore duplicate detection warnings
7. Store same data in multiple places
8. Sync unnecessary data (like Per Diem rules every time)

---

## 🔐 Data Integrity Rules

### **Unique IDs:**
- Each entry MUST have unique ID
- Preserve backend IDs when syncing
- Use generateId() only for new entries

### **Employee ID Validation:**
- All entries MUST have valid employeeId
- Check employee exists before saving
- Orphaned entries = data corruption

### **Date Handling:**
- Always use YYYY-MM-DD format
- Parse dates as local (not UTC)
- Avoid timezone conversion issues

### **Duplicate Prevention:**
- Check by ID first
- Check by data signature second
- Log when duplicates are prevented

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### **Mobile App Logs:**
```
✅ = Success
❌ = Error
🔄 = Syncing
📥 = Downloading
📤 = Uploading
💾 = Saving
🔍 = Checking
```

### **Key Log Messages:**
```
✅ Mileage entry saved locally, auto-sync will handle backend
🔄 SyncIntegration: Queued create operation for mileage_entries
ℹ️ ApiSync: Receipt already exists by ID, skipping
⚠️ ApiSync: Duplicate receipt detected, skipping
```
